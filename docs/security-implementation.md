# Security Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of Row Level Security (RLS) policies and other security measures in our Supabase database.

## Phase 1: User-Specific Data (Completed)

### Tables Secured
| Table | Access Level | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| user_settings | Private | User-specific settings and preferences |
| notifications | Private | User-specific notification messages |
| bookmarks | Private | User's saved topics |
| likes | Public Read, Private Write | Public visibility of likes, private management |

### RLS Policies Implemented

#### user_settings
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own settings" 
  ON public.user_settings FOR SELECT 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own settings" 
  ON public.user_settings FOR UPDATE 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own settings" 
  ON public.user_settings FOR INSERT 
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### notifications
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own notifications" 
  ON public.notifications FOR SELECT 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create notifications" 
  ON public.notifications FOR INSERT 
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own notifications" 
  ON public.notifications FOR DELETE 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### bookmarks
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own bookmarks" 
  ON public.bookmarks FOR SELECT 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create bookmarks" 
  ON public.bookmarks FOR INSERT 
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own bookmarks" 
  ON public.bookmarks FOR DELETE 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### likes
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read likes" 
  ON public.likes FOR SELECT 
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create likes" 
  ON public.likes FOR INSERT 
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own likes" 
  ON public.likes FOR DELETE 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Performance Impact
*Note: These metrics will be updated after running the performance tests*

| Operation | Baseline (ms) | With RLS (ms) | Impact |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| SELECT    | TBD          | TBD           | TBD     |
| INSERT    | TBD          | TBD           | TBD     |
| UPDATE    | TBD          | TBD           | TBD     |

### Edge Cases Verified
- ✅ NULL user IDs properly handled
- ✅ Deleted user data remains protected
- ✅ Concurrent access properly restricted
- ✅ Orphaned data properly secured
- ✅ Public read access for likes
- ✅ Private write access for all user data

### Testing Strategy
1. **Basic Policy Tests**
   - Unauthenticated access blocked
   - Authenticated users can access own data
   - Users cannot access other users' data

2. **Edge Case Tests**
   - NULL user ID handling
   - Deleted user data protection
   - Concurrent access restrictions

3. **Performance Tests**
   - 1000 iterations of each operation
   - Measures SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE performance
   - Tracks execution time impact

### Application Testing
- [ ] User settings management
- [ ] Notification system
- [ ] Bookmark functionality
- [ ] Like/unlike functionality

## Phase 2: Core Content (Planned)

### Tables to Secure
- [ ] topics
- [ ] comments
- [ ] arguments
- [ ] votes
- [ ] categories

### Planned Policies
*To be implemented and documented*

## Phase 3: Auxiliary Data (Planned)

### Tables to Secure
- [ ] achievements
- [ ] user_achievements
- [ ] user_points
- [ ] analytics_cache
- [ ] daily_topics

### Planned Policies
*To be implemented and documented*

## Security Best Practices
1. Always test policies with both authenticated and unauthenticated users
2. Monitor performance impact of RLS policies
3. Document all security changes
4. Test edge cases thoroughly
5. Verify application functionality after each change

## Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered:
1. Disable RLS on affected tables:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.table_name DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
2. Drop problematic policies:
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_name" ON public.table_name;
```
3. Restore previous permissions:
```sql
GRANT ALL ON public.table_name TO authenticated;
```
