# Security Implementation

## Changes Made

This PR implements comprehensive security features for the API routes:

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - In-memory rate limiting system
   - Different limits for different route types:
     - Auth routes: 5 requests/minute
     - Protected routes: 20 requests/minute
     - Public routes: 60 requests/minute
   - Automatic cleanup of old entries
   - Rate limit headers in responses

2. **Input Validation**
   - Zod schemas for all API endpoints
   - Validation middleware for:
     - Request body
     - Query parameters
     - URL parameters
   - Detailed error messages

3. **Protected Routes**
   - Authentication checks
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - Proper error handling

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for rate limiting
- [ ] Unit tests for validation
- [ ] Integration tests for protected routes
- [ ] Manual testing of rate limits
- [ ] Manual testing of validation

## Documentation

- [ ] Added security documentation
- [ ] Updated API documentation
- [ ] Added testing instructions

## Implementation Details

### Rate Limiting

The rate limiting system uses an in-memory store to track requests. Each request is identified by a combination of IP address and route path. The system automatically cleans up old entries to prevent memory leaks.

### Validation

The validation system uses Zod schemas to define the expected shape of request data. The middleware automatically validates incoming requests and returns detailed error messages for invalid data.

## Future Improvements

1. Add Redis-based rate limiting for distributed systems
2. Implement IP-based blocking for repeated violations
3. Add rate limit monitoring and logging
4. Create a dashboard for viewing rate limit statistics

## Breaking Changes

None. This is a non-breaking change that adds security features to existing routes.

## Dependencies

- Added `zod` for validation
- No external dependencies for rate limiting
